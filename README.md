## Foudations of Machine Learning (CS 564)

* Implementation of [K-Means & K-Mediod Clustering algorithms](https://github.com/nikunjpansari/Machine_Learning_CS564/tree/main/K_Means_K_Mediod) on the [Country-set dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data). Based on the results of the Cluster obtained from both the clustering algorithms Infering the number of developed,developing and under-developing countries

-> Clustering  metric used for Inferences : [Silhouette Index](https://github.com/nikunjpansari/Machine_Learning_CS564/blob/main/K_Means_K_Mediod/CS564-2022_%20Assignment_1.pdf)

* Implementation of [DBScan Clustering algorithms](https://github.com/nikunjpansari/Machine_Learning_CS564/tree/main/DBScan) on the [blob,moon & circle dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/9jbpw1ah58jcvva5bzwdl/h?dl=0&rlkey=4ao0wdd9ipyvwuhpp0edvqic2).
