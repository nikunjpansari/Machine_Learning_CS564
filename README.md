## Foudations of Machine Learning (CS 564)

* [Implementation of K-Means & K-Mediod Clustering algorithms on the Country-set dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data). Based on the results of the Cluster obtained from both the clustering algorithms nfering the number of developed,developing and under-developing countries](https://github.com/nikunjpansari/Machine_Learning_CS564/tree/main/K_Means_K_Mediod)
-> Clustering  metric used for Inferences : Silhouette Score
